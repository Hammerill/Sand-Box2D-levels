# Sand-Box2D Levels Documentation
If you're new here, read [contributing sector](#contributing).

## Topics
- [Level File](./README-level-file.md)
- [Objects](./README-objects.md)
- [Index](./README-index.md)

## Contributing
It's good to make a separate directory for single level in the [levels directory](../levels/),
but it's also OK to make a directory for series of levels or even personal author catalog.

This folder should contain [main level file](./README-level-file.md),
can contain assets and other files that might be used.

Every level and all its files have to be [indexed](./README-index.md).

After you've did it all (in your fork of this repo),
you're free to make a pull request and publish your level here.
